# COMP30024 2021 Sem 1 AI Game Playing Agent
This project was done at the University of Melbourne during my undergraduate studies and focuses around an agent that utilises the MIMIMAX and alpha-beta perfect play strategy with Search Extension Evaluation (SEE). 

It was pretty fun, even though we were clammed down with multiple group projects I learnt a lot from it.
